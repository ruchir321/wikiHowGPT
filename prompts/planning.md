# Planning

Using Cloud Opus 4 to streamline development

This looks like a great project! You're building a WikiHow-focused chatbot with some interesting features. Let me help you think through the architecture and implementation.

## Key Components Analysis

### Core Features

1. **TLDR Summarization** - Condensing lengthy WikiHow articles
2. **Question Answering** - Helping users find specific information
3. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** - Combining retrieval with generation for better responses

### Tech Stack

- **Vector DB**: Redis (good choice for real-time operations)
- **Framework**: LangChain (solid for agent orchestration)
- **Search**: DuckDuckGo (for web search capabilities)

## Implementation Suggestions

### 1. RAG Architecture

```python
# Basic RAG flow
1. User Query → 
2. Vector Search (Redis) → 
3. Retrieve relevant WikiHow content →
4. Augment prompt with context →
5. Generate response
```

### 2. Data Collection Strategy

For the "Do I need local data for RAG?" question:

- **Option A**: Scrape WikiHow articles proactively and store in Redis
  - Pros: Faster retrieval, offline capability
  - Cons: Storage costs, need to handle updates
  
- **Option B**: Real-time retrieval via DuckDuckGo
  - Pros: Always fresh content, no storage needed
  - Cons: Slower, dependent on internet

- **Hybrid Approach** (Recommended): Cache frequently accessed articles locally, fetch others on-demand

### 3. Agent Tools to Consider

Beyond DuckDuckGo, you might want:

- **WikiHow API** (if available) or custom scraper
- **Text chunking tool** for large articles
- **Category classifier** to route queries appropriately

### 4. LangGraph Integration

LangGraph would be excellent for:

- Complex multi-step workflows (e.g., search → summarize → answer)
- Conditional logic based on query type
- Better error handling and retry mechanisms

## Sample Implementation Structure

```python
# agents/wiki_agent.py
class WikiAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.redis_client = self._init_redis()
        self.llm = self._init_llm()
        self.tools = self._init_tools()
    
    async def process_query(self, query: str):
        # Determine query intent
        intent = self._classify_intent(query)
        
        if intent == "summarize":
            return await self._summarize_article(query)
        elif intent == "question":
            return await self._answer_question(query)
```

## Next Steps

1. Set up Redis with vector indexing
2. Create document ingestion pipeline
3. Implement basic RAG retrieval
4. Add summarization capabilities
5. Integrate LangGraph for complex workflows

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of the implementation?
